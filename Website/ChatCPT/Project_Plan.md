First, you will need to decide on the layout and design of your website. This can be done by sketching out a rough layout on paper or using a wireframing tool such as Balsamiq or Moqups.

I want to create a website to showcase my Portfolio for potential employers. I want to front screen to be eye catching with simulations and some videos. I also want to have information tabs to see what and when I made some projects and any paper they want to read.

Once you have a rough layout, you can start building the HTML structure of your website. This will involve creating different sections and elements such as headers, footers, navigation, and main content areas.

Next, you can add CSS to style your website. CSS is used to control the layout, colors, and typography of your website. You can use CSS selectors to target specific elements on your website and apply styles to them.

Finally, you can use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website. JavaScript can be used to create animations, handle user input, and perform other tasks that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with just HTML and CSS.

As you continue to build your website, you can use tools such as version control software like git and a local web server to test and debug your code.

Once you are satisfied with your website, you can deploy it to a web hosting service, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP, and make it live for the world to see.
